**Expected:** Graceful handling of missing resources  
**Actual:** Potential NullReferenceExceptions

**Fix Required:**
```csharp
// Replace:
BotPart[] allParts = Resources.LoadAll<BotPart>("BotParts");

// With:
BotPart[] allParts = Resources.LoadAll<BotPart>("BotParts");
if (allParts == null || allParts.Length == 0)
{
    Debug.LogWarning("No bot parts found in Resources/BotParts");
    allParts = new BotPart[0];
}
```

## High Priority Issues (P1 - Fix Before Beta)

### 1. Performance Monitoring System
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Poor performance on low-end devices

**Issues Found:**
- Frame rate monitoring runs every frame without optimization

- Performance optimization triggers too aggressive
- Memory usage not monitored

**Files Affected:**
- `Z:\AI_Software\ExecutiveSuite\CircuitRunners\Assets\Scripts\Core\GameManager.cs` (lines 654-720)

**Recommendations:**
1. Sample frame rate every 10 frames instead of every frame
2. Adjust thresholds per platform (30fps mobile, 60fps desktop)
3. Add memory pressure monitoring
4. Implement graduated performance scaling

### 2. Save System Encryption Weakness  
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Easy save file manipulation by users

**Issues Found:**
- Simple XOR encryption easily reversible
- Static encryption key in code
- No save file integrity checking
- No cloud backup validation

**Files Affected:**
- `Z:\AI_Software\ExecutiveSuite\CircuitRunners\Assets\Scripts\Data\ResourceManager.cs` (lines 952-989)

**Expected:** Secure save file protection  
**Actual:** Trivial to hack currency/progression

**Fix Required:**
1. Implement AES encryption with device-unique key
2. Add HMAC for integrity verification  
3. Validate saves against server data
4. Obfuscate sensitive values

### 3. Monetization Balance Issues
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Poor monetization performance, user frustration

**Issues Found:**
- Energy system too restrictive (5 runs max, 20min regeneration)
- Interstitial ads too frequent (every 3 runs, 3min cooldown)
- Premium currency rewards too low
- No progression-based pricing

**Files Affected:**
- `Z:\AI_Software\ExecutiveSuite\CircuitRunners\Assets\Scripts\Monetization\MonetizationManager.cs`
- `Z:\AI_Software\ExecutiveSuite\CircuitRunners\Assets\Scripts\Data\ResourceManager.cs`

**Recommendations:**
1. Increase energy cap to 7-8 runs
2. Reduce interstitial frequency to every 5 runs
3. Add progressive energy regeneration (faster early game)
4. Implement dynamic pricing based on player spending behavior
