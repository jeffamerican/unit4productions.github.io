## 1. Unity Package Dependencies Setup

### Files Created/Modified:
- `CircuitRunners/Packages/manifest.json` - Unity package dependencies

### Installation Steps:

1. **Open Unity Hub** and load the Circuit Runners project
2. **Wait for package resolution** - Unity will automatically install packages from manifest.json
3. **Verify package installation** in Window > Package Manager:
   - Unity Ads (4.12.2)
   - Unity IAP (4.12.2) 
   - Firebase SDK dependencies
   - Analytics and Remote Config packages

### If packages fail to install:
```bash
# Delete Library folder and let Unity regenerate
rm -rf Library/
# Unity will re-download all packages on next project load
```

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Create new project: "circuit-runners-mobile"
3. Add Android app with package: `com.yourcompany.circuitrunners`
4. Download `google-services.json`

#### 2.2 Unity Configuration
1. **Place google-services.json**:
   ```
   CircuitRunners/Assets/StreamingAssets/google-services.json
   ```
2. **Configure FirebaseBootstrap**:
   - Add FirebaseBootstrap prefab to your main scene
   - Enable required services in inspector:
     - ✅ Enable Authentication
     - ✅ Enable Firestore

#### 2.3 iOS Setup (if targeting iOS)
1. Add iOS app in Firebase Console
2. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
3. Place in `Assets/Plugins/iOS/` folder

### Testing Firebase Integration:
```csharp
// Check if Firebase is working
if (FirebaseBootstrap.Instance.IsInitialized)
{
    Debug.Log("Firebase ready!");
}
else if (FirebaseBootstrap.Instance.IsOfflineMode)
{
    Debug.Log("Running in offline mode");
}
```

- Improved object pooling with automatic expansion
- Pool size limits prevent memory issues
- Smart resource loading with fallbacks

### Performance Testing:
1. Run on target device (Android/iOS)
2. Monitor frame rate in Unity Profiler
3. Verify memory usage stays stable during extended play
4. Test performance optimizations activate under load

- **Duplicate Purchase Detection** prevents fraud
- **Platform-specific Validation** using Unity's built-in validators
- **Audit Trail** for compliance and debugging

### Security Configuration:
1. **Replace placeholder keys** in PurchaseValidator.cs:
   ```csharp
   private const string GOOGLE_PLAY_LICENSE_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_LICENSE_KEY";
   ```
2. **Enable receipt validation** for production builds
3. **Configure server-side validation** for additional security

### Issue: Performance drops on older devices
**Solution**: Verify performance optimizations are enabled and triggering correctly

### Issue: Save data corruption
**Solution**: Check backup restoration works, verify encryption keys are consistent

### Issue: Purchase validation fails
**Solution**: Ensure license keys are set, test with actual purchases not test accounts

### Issue: Player balance feels off
**Solution**: Review segmentation thresholds, check balance parameters per segment
